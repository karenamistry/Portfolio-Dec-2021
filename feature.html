        <h4>Feature is a news sorting application that aims to keep young people interested in political topics that interest them.</h4>
        <p> The application allows users to track following topics in chronological order as well as parse through articles from various news sources.

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>Federal election season in Canada had just finished, and I had noticed that a lot of my peers had an interest in politics but were unsure about where to begin. I had come to the conclusion, after researching, that the over saturation of information in Canadian political news, had led to a lack of interest for young people.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h4>Proposal</h4>
        <p>I had chosen Canadian politics as my research topic & I had come up with an initial area to focus my attention. My initial research question was very broad, but I started by asking: <em> How do young people make decisions concerning politics? </em> 
        </p>
        <h4>Literature Review</h4>
        <p>I began with a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/197ewx4ru969mez/Speculative%20Proposal%20-%20Karena%20Mistry.pdf?dl=0" target="blank">literature review & proposal</a> to further specify my topic. I was able to gather information from a variety of topics pertaining to Canadian politics. Such as what types of traits and branding decisions are appealing to a young voter, the introduction of social media and internet tools into government & how young people consume news. As my research continued, my research question evolved.
        </p>

        <h4>Questionnaire & Focus Group</h4>
        <p>I  conducted an online questionnaire to about 20 people to gather some preliminary research asking basic questions concerning politics. The answers I received were very broad, and didn't lead me towards a conclusive problem that I could solve. This did help me however come up with better, more specific questions for my focus group.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I conducted a focus group to get qualitative data. The group consisted of 4 participants, all female, between the ages of 21-22 years. I chose to do a focus group, rather than interviews because I felt that I could get more information from my participants that way. The conversational manner of the focus group made it easier for participants to add to other points being made, which actually ended up being very useful. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I found that the majority of participants use social media as their main source of political news. Specific sites given were Twitter, Snapchat & Medium as places where articles are more easily consumed. It wa also found that participants felt reminded to get interested in politics only during election periods because when asked, all my participants had voted in at lease one election. <br><br> An interesting piece of information that I was not able to solve for in my final solution was language barriers. Many of my participants spoke a language other than english at home and felt that having news available in languages other than english would be useful. Many people in my focus group felt that online news & social media platforms are not common for news consumption by people who are not fluent in English or speak second languages. Getting news from television media is the more common way to consume non-English news.
        </p>

        <h4>Competition Analysis</h4>
        <p>I researched quite a few news applications (such as CBC news app, Globe & Mail , Google News..etc.) to understand the functions & sorting used in journalism. The most interesting products that I found were TownHall & Visitor (No longer exists) because they do more than just provide news articles.
        </p>

            <img class="image-size-1" src="/feature-images/competition-analysis.svg" alt="">

      
        <h4>Persona</h4>
        <p>I created a persona based off my target audience & focus group for the application. I was able to use information from my focus group to come up with a realistic idea of who would be using the application on a daily basis.
        </p>

            <div class="persona"> 
                <img class="image-size-4" src="/feature-images/persona-1.jpeg" alt="">
                <img class="image-size-5" src="/feature-images/persona-1.svg" alt="">
            </div>

        <h4>Organizing my findings</h4>
        <p>I placed all my finding into a spreadsheet and marked similar topics together. Doing this, I was able to sort my data into two main topics:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>A. Barriers to entry for political news.</p>
        <p>Many of my participants stated they simply felt bored by politics. They felt like they couldn’t relate to any of the topics discussed in the news, because they could not see how it impacted their lives, and it lead to a lack of motivation. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>B. Lack of disparity in politics.</p>
        <p>Many of my participants felt that their vote didn’t matter as much because their specific riding had a history of voting a certain way. When asked how often they vote, all participants had voted in at least 1 election. This shows that young people are still voting, regardless of whether they think their vote is going to make a difference.

        <h4>Timeline</h4>
        <p>I created a timeline, based on weeks I had to work on the design for this project with more than enough buffer room to work with.
        </p>

            <img class="image-size-1" src="/feature-images/timeline.svg" alt="">

        <h4>Design Implications</h4>
        <p>Using my research to inform me, I was able to understand what kind of features would be useful in a news service application. If I allowed users to pick and choose topics that interest them, then I can solve for the lack of political interest in young people. If I am also able to provide  different types of news into the product, then users can view topics in their proffered format. 
        </p>
        <h4>Iterating</h4>
        <p>I began my iteration process with sketches, then moved to mid fidelity mockups. <em> This is where my process was halted because of COVID-19. I needed to rush to finalize my project due to unforeseen time constraints. For this reason, I was not able to conduct user testing to further iterate and confirm my design choices.</em>

        <h4>Parse through articles</h4>
        <p>Articles are summarized in 150-200 words, so users can get a brief insight into a topic before reading further into the topic or similar articles.</p>
    
                <img class="image-size-3" src="/feature-images/sol-1/article.jpg" alt="">

        <h4>Topics are given a timeline</h4>
        <p>Users are able to read articles in chronological order to track breaking stories. Not only does this make for better visual understanding of news topics, but allows user to catch up on the news they've missed.
        </p>

        <img class="image-size-5" src="/feature-images/sol-1/timeline.png" alt="">

        <h4>Create a discourse</h4>
        <p>Participate in a forum type discussions about specific articles, so users can see how different people are being affected by certain policy.
        </p>

        <img class="image-size-5" src="/feature-images/sol-1/comment.png" alt="">

        <h4>All types of Media</h4>
        <p>Explore different types of content, such as video, reels, & podcasts. Allowing users to learn about topics in their preferred medium.

        <h4>Takeaways & Concluding thoughts</h4>
        <p>This project was very heavy on research and unfortunately due to COVID-19, I wasn't able to present a complete design process, though I am still pleased with the final product.</p>
       <br>
        <p>I would like to do some user testing for this product. I did a lot of research work for this product, and having solid feedback from users could take it to the next level. There are features in the application that need to be refined, like having the ability to filter topics/articles by day, week, month etc. </p>
