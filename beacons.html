    <div class="overview">
        <h4>Beacons is an existing retail assistant that aims to help retail employees by letting them know when a customer is in need of assistance.</h4>
        <p>Press a button and an employee gets a notification! This product is implemented in the Canadian Tire Kanata store, in Ottawa & Canadian Tire Georgetown, in Halton Hills.

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p> When a customer goes into a store looking to buy a product, they are hoping to receive a certain level of customer service in order to make a proper buying decision. In large retail stores, tracking who needs help and where can become an issue.

        <h4>Interview</h4>
        <p>I scheduled an in-person interview with a Canadian Tire employee. My interview lasted about half an hour. My interviewee is the retail manager at Canadian Tire Kanata & Project Lead at Beacons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The biggest pain point was that there was a divide between the older & younger employees about using the application due to ease of use. </p>

        <h4>Competition Analysis</h4>
        <p>I was able to research two competitor products to Beacons. The first Synq Order Up, is used specifically for expensive lockup items that require employee intervention to purchase. Acuity Playbook is more similar to Beacons, except it suggests paths for employees to take in order to successfully sell product.
        </p>

        <h4>Personas</h4>

        <p>I created two personas based off my target audience for the application. I was able to use information from my interview to come up with a realistic idea of who would be using the application on a daily basis.</p>

            <h4>Site Map</h4>
            <p>I was given access to the Beacons application, and I was able to reorder the site map to better prioritize the needs of the application. The biggest change I made to the site map was removing the dashboard as the landing page and instead making the landing the current customer requests page. </p>

        <h4>Understand</h4>
        <p>Using the Design Sprint Method, I started by asking "How Might We" questions. I listened back to my initial interview, while jotting down questions regarding changes and features I should make implement.
        </p>

        <h4>User Flow</h4>
        <p>I created a flow chart to better understand the checkpoints I needed to hit in the customer request flow. This is when a customer presses a button and a retail employee answers their request. </p>
        <img class="image-size-3" src="/beacons-images/User Flow - Requests.png" alt="">

        <h4>Define</h4>
        <p>Beacons was created with the goal of enhancing the customer to employee service experience, not eliminating it. My goal was to expand the reach of the beacons app to more retail stores with a clearer design that emphasizes employee success, instead of retailer success alone.
        </p>
        <h4>Sketching</h4>
        <p>After looking at references and creating a moodboard, I started by doing a Crazy 8's exercise to get my ideas out of my head and on paper. From there, I was able to start my mid-fidelity mockups and a first iteration for the main customer requests page.
        </p>

            <img class="image-size-2" src="/beacons-images/Low-fid.jpeg" alt="">
        

        <h4>First Iteration & Second Iteration</h4>
        <p>I began prototyping, and created two different flow iterations for answering a customer request, meaning how does the employee respond when a customer presses a button in the store. The reason I did this was because I wasn't sure what employees would value having more: Prioritizing the in progress customer requests or prioritizing the escalated requests. I knew I could verify this later with user testing. Another difference between these iterations is the layout for the customer request summary page.

        <h4>User Testing</h4>
        <p>I was able to schedule a 20 minute in person casual interview with the same employee at Canadian Tire that I had previously interviewed and get some feedback on the direction & design decisions in the redesign.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>"Logs" was the term I had been using to refer to the call requests. Logs refers to logistics in retail so it was confusing. It was suggests that having a graph showing busiest times of day would be important to know</p>
        <h4>Third Iteration</h4>
        <p>After user testing, I was able to make changes to the design that would better solve the problems I was having. One of the major changes I made, was the addition of an "inprogress" state for requests. This means that employees can now see who is busy with a request at a glance. If they would like more information, like what specific SKU they are busy with, they can visit the In progress page.
        </p>

        <h4>Improved Request Flow</h4>

        <h4>Static data no more</h4>
        <p>Statistics are given context with data visualizations that can give retail employees data they need on the go.</p>

        <h4>Accessability Adjustments</h4>
        <p>Providing large font sizes & more contrast makes the new ui better equipped to function for older employees.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h4>Onboarding</h4>
        <p> When an employee is first greeted by the application, they are asked about their goals so that I can better suit the application for retail employees.
        </p>

            </div>


        <h4>Customer Request Flow</h4>
        <p>How an employee receives requests when customers press the beacons button. Telling employees where and when the button was pressed, as well if their other department coworkers are already occupied with customers.
        </p>

            <div class="sol-side">

                <img class="image-sol" src="/beacons-images/sol-1/X-10.png" alt="">
            </div>

        <h4>Personal Achievements</h4>
        <p>The previous system of having a CXS (customer experience) score for the entire store was impersonal and did not do anything to encourage employee success. By implementing a personal badge & level system for retail employees, they are able to see their progression separate from their store success and their coworkers.
        </p>

        <div class="sol-side">
            <img class="image-sol" src="/beacons-images/sol-2/X-19.png" alt="">
            <img class="image-sol" src="/beacons-images/sol-2/X-28.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h4>Beacons Editing</h4>
        <p>Organizing beacon buttons by department & SKU, which can be searched, makes it easier to find and edit beacons on-the-go. Previously, all the beacons were all listed together. The icons provide more clarity as well.
        </p>

        <div class="sol-side">

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="content">
        <h4>Takeaways & Concluding thoughts</h4>
        <p>I'm hoping to work with DCXS (Beacons' parent company) to implement this redesign so that they can expand this product to more retail stores in Canada.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I want to do more user testing with workers at Canadian Tire. If I can find more people to talk to, I'm sure that I can make this product more efficient. Talking with just one employee isn't enough to get accurate data, but it was all I could get access to. </p>
